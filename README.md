Background
I pursued a career in Data Science at ExcelR in Bangalore, India. I'm passionate about applying machine learning and artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems. I have worked on various projects, including a Twitter Sentiment Analysis App, a Book Recommendation App, and an ongoing side project called Garuda.

Projects
1. Twitter Sentiment Analysis App
This was a collaborative group project that involved creating a Machine Learning application to determine the sentiment of any given tweet. The primary goal was to improve ad recommendations by understanding user sentiment. The project successfully provided insights into user sentiment, helping advertisers tailor their ad campaigns effectively.

2. Book Recommendation App
This was a collaborative group project aimed at recommending books to users based on various factors such as previous ratings, locations, and reading habits. The app leveraged machine learning algorithms to provide personalized book recommendations to enhance the reading experience for users.

3. Garuda
Garuda is an ongoing side project focusing on AI and machine learning to predict day-to-day stock market trades. The goal is to achieve a monthly average profit of 3%. This ambitious project involves developing advanced predictive models and utilizing real-time data for making informed trading decisions.

Current Status
I am actively seeking employment opportunities in the Machine Learning domain. If you are interested in collaborating or have any opportunities, please feel free to contact me at my email address: anupamramesh99@gmail.com.
