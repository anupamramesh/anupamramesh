Background
I pursued a career in Data Science at ExcelR in Bangalore, India. I'm passionate about applying machine learning and artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems. I have worked on various projects, including a Twitter Sentiment Analysis App, a Book Recommendation App, and an ongoing side project called Garuda.

At Ai Variant, I led three successful AI projects. I developed machine learning models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN) for energy production optimization that increased efficiency by 15%. Additionally, I built a sentiment analysis tool (BERT, LMST, Naive Bayes, Keras) that improved brand perception on Twitter, resulting in a increase in positive mentions and brand recognition. Furthermore, I designed a book recommendation model (Popularity, Cosine Similarity, TF-IDF, Collaborative Filtering) that utilized collaborative filtering to boost customer engagement. Proficient in data visualization and analysis, I effectively communicated complex insights to stakeholders.
Throughout these projects, I collaborated closely with cross-functional teams, including data scientists and engineers, to ensure comprehensive solutions. My proficiency in data visualization and analysis facilitated clear and effective communication of complex insights to stakeholders.
